# Food Explorer - Frontend

This project is the result of the final challenge of Rocketseat's Explorer course. The goal was to develop an application for a restaurant, providing users with the ability to register, place orders, make payments, track order status, and add items to favorites. Additionally, it allows a user with administrative privileges to add new items to the menu and update the status of orders.

The result can be seen at: https://fdexplorer.netlify.app/
